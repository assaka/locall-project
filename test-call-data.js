Agent: I'm sorry to hear about the delay. Let me look that up for you. Can you provide your order number?

Customer: Yes, it's order number 12345. I'm getting a bit frustrated as I need this for an important meeting.

Agent: I completely understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me check that right away... I see your order here. Unfortunately, there was a delay with our shipping partner, but I can see it was dispatched yesterday and should arrive by tomorrow.

Customer: Oh that's great news! I was getting worried. Will I get tracking information?

Agent: Absolutely! I'll send the tracking details to your email right now. And as an apology for the delay, I'm going to add a 15% discount to your next order. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Customer: No, that's perfect. Thank you so much for your help and for the discount! You've been really helpful.

Agent: You're very welcome! Have a great day and enjoy your order when it arrives.`,
